^1^ With the exception of singleton libraries like `react`

^2^ Let's say that you have `logger` as a lib, throughout time you'll end up with `logger@1.x.x`, `logger@2.x.x`, etc. At same point you'll likely want to align this again for runtime performance reasons

^3^ Expanding on the example in ^1^, let's say at `HEAD` we currently have `logger@2.0.0`. But `AppA` uses `logger@1.2.3` and we discover a bug there, we'll need a way to get the source code from `logger@1.2.3` and use it at `HEAD`

^1^ Updates of singleton libraries like `react` must be co-ordinated and in one go
^2^ singleton libraries are not allowed to have multiple versions. Flagging dependencies as singleton is manual process
^3^ provided the dependencies adhere to Semantic Versioning!
^4^ A Platform team could be CODEOWNER of the root `package.json` and determine if a new major version is acceptable or not. An internal policy could set a maximum to `n` major versions per dependency

^2^: If we have a new major version, we "fork" it by copying it: `libs/logger` -> `lib/logger_v2`
